Insufficient system memory: If your system does not have enough available memory to allocate 6GB to the PHP script, it may cause a fatal error.\n\n1. PHP configuration: Some server configurations may restrict the maximum memory limit that can be set for a PHP script. Check your PHP configuration file (php.ini) to see if there's a hard limit set for the memory_limit directive.\n\n1. Error reporting/display settings: PHP may be suppressing error messages or not displaying them on the page. You can enable error reporting and display to get more information about the issue.

Those numbers will then implicitly be treated as coordinates of a point. It then measures the square of the distance between point (x,y) and point (0,0); it does so by squaring x and y and summing the squares. Next, it checks if this squared distance is less than 1 and thus, if the non-squared distance is less than the square root of 1, or simply 1. In other words, the code checks if this point lies inside a circle of radius 1 and origin (0,0).\n\nThe code does the above 10 000 times, as defined by the last line of the code. \n\nThe probability of a single iteration of the above method resulting in a hit (in a point hitting the inside of the circle) is pi/4 - that's because the points can land anywhere in a square of side 1, but it only counts in the area where this square overlaps with a circle - this area happens to be a quartercircle. The probability is thus equal to (area of the quartercircle)/(area of the square) = (pi * 1^2 /4) / 1 = pi / 4.\n\nWhile randomness will never be fully predictable, we can be statistically sure that given enough trials (10 000, as mentioned), the ratio of the number of hits to the total number of trials will be close to the above probability. Thus, the code takes this ratio and multiplies it by 4 to extract an approximation of pi from an approximation of this pi / 4 fraction.\n\nThe code then prints out the result (the number pi)."}], "is_classification": false}

For more balanced usage the amortized time will be closer to O(1)."}], "is_classification": false}
