Insufficient system memory: If your system does not have enough available memory to allocate 6GB to the PHP script, it may cause a fatal error. 1. PHP configuration: Some server configurations may restrict the maximum memory limit that can be set for a PHP script. Check your PHP configuration file (php.ini) to see if there's a hard limit set for the memory_limit directive. 1. Error reporting/display settings: PHP may be suppressing error messages or not displaying them on the page. You can enable error reporting and display to get more information about the issue. Add the following lines to the beginning of your PHP script: ```php ini_set('display_errors', 1); ini_set('display_startup_errors', 1); error_reporting(E_ALL); ``` After adding these lines, run your script again and see if any error messages are displayed. 1. Web server timeout: If your PHP script takes too long to execute, the web server may time out, causing the script to stop running and returning a blank page. Check your web server's timeout settings and adjust them if needed. To resolve the issue, you can try: - Reducing the memory limit to a lower value, e.g., '512M', '1G', or '2G', and see if the script runs without issues. - Checking your server's available memory and ensuring it can accommodate the desired memory limit. - Reviewing your PHP and web server configurations for any restrictions or timeout settings that might be causing the problem.

The probability of a single iteration of the above method resulting in a hit (in a point hitting the inside of the circle) is pi/4 - that's because the points can land anywhere in a square of side 1, but it only counts in the area where this square overlaps with a circle - this area happens to be a quartercircle.

To define the factorial function correctly, you can use the following code: ``` factorial 0 = 1 factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1) ``` This code defines the factorial function using a recursive approach that handles the base case for `n=0` and then recursively computes the factorial for `n-1` until it reaches the base case. Note that in Haskell, function definitions do not require parentheses around the argument list, so you can define the function as `factorial 0 = 1` instead of `factorial(0)=1`. Also, make sure to use spaces between function names, arguments, and operators, as this is required in Haskell syntax.
